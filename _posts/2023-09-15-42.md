## Population
The whole of all items(scores, people, and so on) to be studied

## Sample
A sample is a sub-collection of elements drawn from a population

> In other words, a sample statistic, such as mean (average), represents our best estimate of the corresponding population parameter.

## Measures of Position

## measures of Central Tendency
A way to see where a certain data point or value falls in a sample or distribution

### Mean
#### Most used measure of central tendency
- Average of all observations
- The sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores
- We can estimate the mean of population by using the mean of sample

### Median
- This is the value of a variable such that half of the observations are above, and half are below this value i.e. this value divides the distribution into two groups of equal size
- When the number of observations is odd, the median is simply equal to the middle value.
- When there are exactly the same number of observations, we consider the median to be the average of the two values in the distribution's middle

### Interquartile Range (IQR)
The interquartile range tells you where the “middle fifty” is in a data set. While the range tells you where the beginning and end are in a set, the IQR shows you where the bulk of the “middling” values lie.

### Outliers
Outliers are unusual values that fall outside of an expected range of values
