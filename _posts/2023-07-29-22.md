## Breadth-First Search
### graph traversal algorithm <br>

Explore all neighbors of a given node and move to each of them <br>
### How it works
1. Visit the root node and enqueue it to a queue <br>
2. Repeat until the queue is not empty <br>
2-1. Dequeue and process the first node in the queue <br>
2-2. Enqueue children of processed nodes


> This method is useful for finding `the shortest path` between two nodes in `unweighted graph`
