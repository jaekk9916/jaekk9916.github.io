## inheritance
can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class<br>
can inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes)<br>
they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass  

## superclasses and subclasses
### private keyword
- be accessed only through the public or protected methods inherited from the superclass
- when the subclass attempts to access the superclass’s private instance variables, compile error happend
protected keyword 
- be accessed only through the public or protected methods inherited from the superclass

### Rules

| Rules of Inheritance | Permission |
|----------------------|------------|
| Multiple Inheritance | X          |
| Cyclic Inheritance   | X          |
| Private Members      | X          |
| Constructors         | X          |


## constructors
super() must be the first statement in the constructor's body of subclass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super(): keyword which call super class's construct<br>
If the code does not include an explicit call to the superclass constructor, Java implicitly calls the superclass’s default or no-argument constructor.

## Object
has no superclass, in other words, is ￼the top most class
is a superclass of every class
