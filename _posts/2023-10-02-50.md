## inheritance
can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class<br>
can inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes)<br>
they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass  

## superclasses and subclasses
### private keyword
- be accessed only through the public or protected methods inherited from the superclass
- when the subclass attempts to access the superclass’s private instance variables, compile error happend
protected keyword 
- be accessed only through the public or protected methods inherited from the superclass

### Rules
|   Rules of Inheritance   |   permission   |
|--------------------------|----------------|
|   Multiple Inheritance   |       X        |
|   Cyclic Inheritance     |       X        |
|   Private members        |       X        |
|   Constructors           |       X        |


## constructors
super() must be the first statement in the constructor's body of subclass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super(): keyword which call super class's construct<br>
If the code does not include an explicit call to the superclass constructor, Java implicitly calls the superclass’s default or no-argument constructor.

## Object
has no superclass, in other words, is ￼the top most class
is a superclass of every class
