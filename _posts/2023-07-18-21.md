There are two type of comparison in JAVA<br>
One is `content` comparison and the other is `address comparison` <br>

### content comparison <br>
Compare if two values refer to the <span style="color:red">same value</span><br>

### address comparison <br>
Compare if two values refer to the <span style="color:blue">same memory address</span><br><br><br>
