## Sequence Diagram
An interaction diagram that describes the steps used to complete a task
Depicts the interaction between objects in the context of collaboration
Focuses on time and uses the vertical axis of the diagram to show the sequence of interactions that send or receive messages

### It arranged vertically and horizontally in accordance with time and objects, depict elements as they interact across time

## Sequence Diagrams captures:

instance diagrams or generic diagrams: the interaction that takes place in a collaboration that either realizes `a use case` or `an operation` 
high-level interactions between user of the system and the system, between the system and other systems, or between subsystems (sometimes known as system sequence diagrams)

## Sequence Diagram Example: Hotel System
### Sequence Diagram is an interaction diagram that details how operations are carried out -- what messages are sent and when. 
1. Sequence diagrams are organized according to time. 
2.The time progresses as you go down the page. 
3.The objects involved in the operation are listed from left to right according to when they take part in the message sequence.

## Object Dimension
The horizontal axis shows the elements that are involved in the interaction
Conventionally, the objects involved in the operation are listed from left to right according to when they take part in the message sequence. However, the elements on the horizontal axis may appear in any order

## Time Dimension
The vertical axis represents time proceedings (or progressing) down the page.


#### sequence diagram for making a hotel reservation
#### The object initiating the sequence of messages is a Reservation window


### User requirements are captured as use cases that are refined into scenarios.
