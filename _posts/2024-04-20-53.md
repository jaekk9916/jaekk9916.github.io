Giving computers the ability to learn without being programmed

## Supervised Learning
Learning from data labeled as 'Correct'
![Pasted image 20240414155214](https://github.com/jaekk9916/jaekk9916.github.io/assets/96701717/f9ed5f55-80b3-4f86-b3b5-7d2872cd79c4)

### Regression
* Predicted value: Predicting a continuous numeric value (an infinite number of outcomes possible)
* Example: Predicting house prices

#### Linear Regression

### Classification
* Predicting the outcome (Y) based on the input (X)
* Predicted value: Discrete categorical values
* Limited number of outcomes possible
* Example: Breast cancer detection

## Unsupervised Learning
![Pasted image 20240414162025](https://github.com/jaekk9916/jaekk9916.github.io/assets/96701717/5d8c439d-c881-46f8-8e10-00fdc4ed28af)
* Finding interesting patterns in unlabeled data
* It's not about finding the correct answer for every input, but rather the algorithm discovering on its own what patterns or structures it might fit into
 

### Clustering
Grouping similar data points together
* Google news

* DNA microarray

*  Grouping customers

The first key steps to implementing Linear Regression are
* Define a Cost Function
  * Definition: Measures the difference between the predicted values obtained using the model's parameters and the actual values from the training data to quantify the error or loss of the model's predictions
  * Minimize value of the cost function by finding the optimal values for the parameters

$$
\begin{align}
J(w,b)=\frac{1}{2m}(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{m}(f_{w,b}(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)})^2
\end{align}
$$<br>
**w** and **b** are parameters of the model, adjusted as the model learns from the data. They’re also referred to as *“coefficients”* or *“weights”*


### How to measure the performance of a classification model
The performance of a classification model is typically measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score<br><br>
$$
\begin{align}
Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{Total\,number\,of\,predictions}
\end{align}
$$<br>
The proportion of instances that are correctly predicted across all predictions<br><br>
$$
\begin{align}
Precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}\\
\end{align}
$$<br>
The proportion of true positives among the values predicted as True by the model<br><br>
$$
\begin{align}
Recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}
\end{align}
$$<br>
The proportion of true predictions made by the model that are actually true<br><br>
$$
\begin{align}
F1 Score(Accuracy + Recall)
\end{align}
$$




### Gradient descent
* Basic techniques widely used in machine learning, including advanced neural network models.
* Algorithms to find the minimum value of a cost function by changing the Weight and Bias (parameters) until the cost function has a minimum value. 
* If the cost function is not bow-shaped or hammock-shaped, there may be more than one possible minimum.
* Finding the global or local minimum of the function.
* Depending on the starting point and the shape of the cost function, you may have local minima with different gradients, so initial conditions are important 
* For linear regression, parameters are often set to zero initially

#### Gradient descent algorithm
$$
\begin{aligned}
&w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial w} J(w, b)\\\\
&\alpha: \text{Learning rate (size)} (\alpha \text{ always has a positive value})\\\\
&\frac{\partial}{\partial w} J(w, b): \text{Derivative (descent direction)}\\\\
\end{aligned}
$$

*The partial derivative of the Cost Function with respect to weight indicates the gradient, and the sign of this gradient determines how weights are adjusted. If the gradient is positive, reduce the weight to decrease the value of the cost function;<br> 
if the gradient is negative, increase the weight to decrease the cost function value*
