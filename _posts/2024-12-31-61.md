# WebRTC
1. Technology that allows voice, video, and data to be sent and received between web browsers in real time
2. Enables P2P communication from within the browser itself, without the need to install any plugins or software
<br><br>
# Mediasoup
1. Powerful Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) media server for WebRTC 
2. As a media server, it relays and manages media streams between participants
3. Written in `Node.js` with a media server core implemented in `C++`
4. Support for real-time video/audio routing
5. Support for multiple codecs (VP8, VP9, H.264, Opus, etc.)
<br><br>
# Multiprocessing in Mediasoup
## 1. Worker pool management

```javascript
// Managing multiple workers through the mediasoup Workers array
const mediasoupWorkers = [];
let nextMediasoupWorkerIdx = 0;
```
<br>

## 2. Create the set number of workers
```javascript
const { numWorkers } = config.mediasoup;
for (let i = 0; i < numWorkers; ++i) {
    const worker = await mediasoup.createWorker({...});
    mediasoupWorkers.push(worker);
}
```
<br>

## 3. Assigning Workers in Round-Robin
```javascript
function getMediasoupWorker() {
    const worker = mediasoupWorkers[nextMediasoupWorkerIdx];
    
    if (++nextMediasoupWorkerIdx === mediasoupWorkers.length)
        nextMediasoupWorkerIdx = 0;
        
    return worker;
}
```
<br>

> `What is a Round-Robin?`<br>
> Round robin is a scheduling algorithm that alternately allocates resources in a sequential order<br>
> * Advantages<br>
> 1. Simple and intuitive implementation<br>
> 2. Provide fair opportunities for all workers<br>
> 3. Evenly distribute CPU load<br>
> 4. Prevents work from being pushed to certain workers <br><br>

> * disadvantages<br>
> 1. Doesn't take into account a worker's current load status<br>
> 2. Difficult to reflect the prioritization of tasks<br>
> 3. Assumes all workers have the same processing power<br>


## 4. Assign Workers to each Room
```javascript
async function getOrCreateRoom({ roomId, consumerReplicas }) {
    if (!room) {
        const mediasoupWorker = getMediasoupWorker();
        room = await Room.create({ mediasoupWorker, roomId, consumerReplicas });
    }
}
```

### Key features
1. Parallelization: Each Worker runs on a separate CPU process, enabling parallel processing.<br>
2. Load balancing: Evenly distributes system load across multiple CPUs by allocating Workers in a round-robin fashion.<br>
3. Monitoring: Periodic monitoring of each worker's resource usage.
   ```javascript
       setInterval(async () => {
        const usage = await worker.getResourceUsage();
        logger.info('mediasoup Worker resource usage [pid:%d]: %o', worker.pid, usage);
    }, 120000);
    ```
4. Failover: Designed to restart the entire process if a worker is terminated.
   ```javascript
       worker.on('died', () => {
        logger.error('mediasoup Worker died, exiting in 2 seconds... [pid:%d]', worker.pid);
        setTimeout(() => process.exit(1), 2000);
    });
   ```
