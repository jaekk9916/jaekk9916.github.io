## Why is calculus important in machine learning?

### Machine Learning
Machine learning models are essentially designed to make predictions or decisions based on input data, and to measure the accuracy of their predictions, they define something called a loss function (or cost function), which measures the difference between the predicted value and the actual value of the data.
Ultimately, the goal of training a machine learning model is to find a set of parameters (weights and biases in the case of neural networks) that minimize this loss function, indicating that the model's predictions are as close as possible to the actual outcome.<br><br>

In this process, __to minimize the value of the loss function, the concept of differentiation is used__

### Where derivatives are used
- The derivative is a measure for determining how far you need to move to reach the minimum value of the loss function, and is used to calculate the slope of the loss function at a particular point(gradient descent) 



* When we want to find the model that best fits the data, we calculate the *loss function* and minimize it, and repeat the process

### Model training
The model starts with an arbitrary line <span>\( \rightarrow \)</span> something that looks like <span>\( Wx + b \)</span>
and then tweak the results to optimize the best possible prediction for the existing data points

#### Related problem types
- Linear Regression
- Classification
	- Sentiment analysis (results are expressed as happy/sad/joyful/etc.)

*Currently, machine learning problems are handled by many different mathematical techniques*.

### Derivative = Derivative
* Derivative is the instantaneous rate of change of a function.
* Derivative of a function at a point = slope of the tangent line at that point
* To find the maximum or minimum value of a function, you must find one of the points where the derivative goes to zero.

### How to represent derivatives
<ul>
  <li>Lagrange's Notation</li>
  <li>\( y = f(x) \rightarrow f'(x) \)</li>
  <li>Leibniz's Notation</li>
  <li>\( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) \)</li>
</ul>

#### Derivatives of line of equation
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= ax + b \rightarrow f'(x) = a \\\\
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} &= \frac{a(x+\Delta x) + b - (ax + b)}{\Delta x} \\\\
\qquad a\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta x} &= a 
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Derivatives - Quadratic Equations
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Quadratics: } y &= f(x) = x^2 \\\\
\;\text{Slope: } \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} &= \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} \\\\
&= \frac{(x+\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x} \\\\
&= \frac{x^2+2x\Delta x+(\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x} \\\\
&= 2x+\Delta x \\\\
& \text{as } \Delta x \rightarrow 0 \\\\
f(x) &= x^2 \rightarrow f'(x)=2x
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Derivatives - Higher degree polynomials
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Cubic: } y &= f(x) = x^3 \\
\text{Slope: } \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} &= \frac{(x+\Delta x)^3 - x^3}{\Delta x} \\
&= \frac{(x^3 + 3x^2\Delta x + 3x(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta x)^3) - x^3}{\Delta x} \\
&= \frac{3x^2\Delta x + 3x(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta x)^3}{\Delta x} \\
&= 3x^2 + 3x\Delta x + (\Delta x)^2 \\\\
&\, \text{as } \Delta x \rightarrow 0 \\
& \Rightarrow f'(x)=3x^2
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Derivative of <span>\\( \frac{1}{x} \\)</span>

$$
\begin{aligned}
Inverse:y=f(x)=x^-1=\frac{1}{x}\\\\
Slope: \frac{{\Delta f}}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x+{\Delta x})-f(x)}{{\Delta x}}\\\\
\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}=\frac{(x+{\Delta x})^-1-x^-1}{{\Delta x}}\\\\
=\frac{\frac{1}{x+{\Delta x}}-\frac{1}{x}}{{\Delta x}}\\\\
=\frac{\frac{x-(x+{\Delta x})}{(x+{\Delta x})x}}{{\Delta x}}\\\\
=-\frac{1}{x^2+x{\Delta x}}\\\\\\\\
as {\Delta x} \rightarrow 0\\\\
f(X)=x^-1 \rightarrow f'(x)=-x^-2
\end{aligned}
$$
