## FOREIGN KEY WITH Cascade DELETE

#### It indicates that when the parent table's entry is deleted, the matching record in the child table is also deleted

It can be used in two ways

  1. CREATE
  ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE [TABLE NAME] (
    ~~
    CONSTRAINT [CONSTRAINT NAME] FOREIGN KEY ([KEY NAME])
    REFERENCES [TABLE NAME] ([COLUMN NAME])
    ON DELETE CASCADE;
  ```
  
  2. ALTER 

```SQL
  ALTER TABLE [CHILD TABLE NAME]
  ADD CONSTRAINT [fk_name]
  FOREIGN KEY ([CHILD COLUMN])
  REFERENCE TABLE [PARENT TABLE] (PARENT COLUMN)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```
