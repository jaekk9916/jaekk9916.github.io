## When it happends conflict
```shell
git fetch --all
git reset --hard orgin/main
git pull origin main
```
`git fetch --all`: Get a pre-crash file from a remote repository
<br>
`git reset --hard origin/main`: Reset Updated local file to pre-conflict
<br>
`git pull origin main`: Do a git pull as usual
<br><br>

## Configure Git to handle line endings
```shell
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

When saving a text file, invisible characters are typed at the end of each line to mark the end of the line. 
<br>These characters are represented differently on different Operating Systems, which can cause conflicts when committing remotely from a local repository. 
<br>To work around this, you can set up Git to automatically convert end-of-line characters to Unix style when committing
