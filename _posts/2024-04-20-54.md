### Image Classification

- **Purpose:** Identifies a single object in an image and assigns it a specific label (e.g., "car").

### Object Localization

- **Purpose:** Recognizes and determines the precise location and size of an object within an image by drawing a bounding box around it.
- **Relation to Object Detection:** It is a fundamental component of object detection, which deals with detecting multiple objects.

### Classification with Localization

- **Outputs:** In addition to the objectâ€™s class, the neural network outputs four parameters (bx, by, bh, bw) that define the bounding box of the detected object. These parameters are part of the output vector y.
- **Bounding Box Coordinates:** The image is conceptually mapped such that the upper-left corner is (0,0) and the lower-right corner is (1,1).
- **Output Vector Components:**
    - **pc:** Indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a classifiable object (not background).
    - **bx, by, bh, bw:** Specify the bounding box dimensions and position.
    - **c1, c2, c3:** Class indicators, which determine whether the object is a pedestrian, car, or motorcycle. When an object is present (pc = 1), one of these indicators will also be 1. If no object is detected, these are irrelevant.
- **Loss Function:** Training uses a sum of squared errors to minimize the differences between predicted outputs and actual labels for all components of y. Focus is on all components when an object is detected, and solely on pc when no object is present.

### Object Detection

- **Purpose:** Detects and localizes multiple objects within a single image, each potentially belonging to different categories.
- **Complexity:** Handles more complex scenes with multiple dynamic and static objects, crucial for applications like autonomous driving.
